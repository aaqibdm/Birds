                    <h3>Gouldian finch</h3><br>
                    <p>The Gouldian finch (Chloebia gouldiae), also known as the Lady Gouldian finch, Gould's finch or
                        the rainbow finch, is a colourful passerine bird that is native to Australia</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Description :</h3><br>
                    <p>Both sexes are brightly coloured with black, green, yellow, and red markings. The females tend to
                        be less brightly coloured. One major difference between the sexes is that the male's chest is
                        purple, while the female's is a lighter mauve.</p>


                        Black-headed female Gouldian finch<p>
                        Gouldian finches are about 125â€“140 mm long. Gouldian finches' heads may be red, black, or
                        yellow. Formerly considered three different kinds of finches, it is now known that these are
                        colour variants that exist in the wild. Selective breeding has also developed mutations
                        (blue, yellow and silver instead of a green back) in both body and breast colour.</p>

                       <p> There are several "prominent rounded tubercles" with an "opalescent lustre" at the back of the
                        gape. These tubercles are commonly (and incorrectly) described as phosphorescent in spite of
                        much scientific evidence to the contrary. It is believed that these tubercles simply reflect
                        light and are not luminescent.</p>
