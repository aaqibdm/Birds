                    <h3>Yellow-naped amazon</h3><br>
                    <p>The yellow-naped amazon or yellow-naped parrot (Amazona auropalliata) is a widespread amazon
                        parrot sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the yellow-crowned amazon (Amazona
                        ochrocephala). It inhabits the Pacific coast of southern Mexico and Central America. It has
                        been recently been reclassified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List due to a dramatic
                        decline across the extent of its range. Yellow-naped amazons have lost more than 92% of
                        their population over the last three generations.</p>

                        <p>The primary cause for their population decline are deforestation and illegal removal of young
                        for the parrot trade. This parrot readily mimics sounds, and in captivity, this includes human
                        speech, which is probably the reason it is popular in aviculture. Like all parrots, however,
                        mimicking abilities vary greatly between individuals. Recent surveys of the Costa Rican
                        population across an 11-year time span found a significant decline in their population. Despite
                        this decline, the Costa Rican population is considered to be the stronghold for the species.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Description :</h3><br>
                    <p>The yellow-naped amazon is distinguished by its green forehead and crown and a yellow band across
                        the lower nape (back part of neck) and hindneck. The eyes are orange, beak is dark gray and is
                        paler towards the base of the upper mandible. The feet are also dark gray.</p>

                        <p>Yellow-naped amazons inhabit dry forest and mangrove habitat of the tropics, and nest in
                        naturally occurring cavities  Although yellow-naped amazons will not excavate cavities, they
                        will chew the entrance. The parrots will nest in a wide variety of trees, although dead Coyols
                        (palm trees) are one preferred species. During the breeding season, pairs are monogamous, and
                        pairs defend small breeding territories around the nest by duetting with their partners.
                        Breeding success is low (89%), and the majority of nests fail due to poaching </p>

                        <p> The vocal behavior of yellow-naped amazons has been more extensively studied than in any other
                        wild parrot. Yellow-naped amazons, like all parrots, exhibit vocal learning behavior in the
                        wild. This behavior manifests in the form of vocal dialects,[8] in which the repertoire of calls
                        that parrots vocalize change at discrete geographic boundaries, similar to how humans have
                        different languages or dialects. These dialects also are meaningful to the parrots; they are
                        less responsive to calls that are not their own dialect.Dialects are also stable over long
                        periods of time.</p>

                        <p>>Mated pairs of yellow-naped amazons also duet together on their territories in highly complex
                        ways; they produce precisely coordinated and synchronized sequences of calls. These duets are
                        organized by syntactic rules, in which the order and structure of notes changes in predetermined
                        but flexible ways.[11][12] Neighboring pairs of birds will counter-duet, in which pairs will
                        rapidly exchange duets. This behavior appears similar to the counter-singing observed in male
                        songbirds. These displays will at times become so heated that physical fights will occur at
                        territory boundaries, although these are rare.</p>
