                    <h3>Eclectus parrot</h3><br>
                    <p>The eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) is a parrot native to the Solomon Islands, Sumba, New
                        Guinea and nearby islands, northeastern Australia, and the Maluku Islands (Moluccas). It is
                        unusual in the parrot family for its extreme sexual dimorphism of the colours of the plumage;
                        the male having a mostly bright emerald green plumage and the female a mostly bright red and
                        purple/blue plumage. Joseph Forshaw, in his book Parrots of the World, noted that the first
                        European ornithologists to see eclectus parrots thought they were of two distinct species. Large
                        populations of this parrot remain, and they are sometimes considered pests for eating fruit off
                        trees. Some populations restricted to relatively small islands are comparably rare. Their bright
                        feathers are also used by native tribespeople in New Guinea as decorations.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Description :</h3><br>
                    <p>The Eclectus Parrot is unusual in the parrot family for its marked visible light sexual dimorphism
                        in the colours of the plumage. A stocky short-tailed parrot, it measures around 35 cm (14 in) in
                        length. The male is mostly bright green with a yellow-tinge on the head. It has blue primaries,
                        and red flanks and underwing coverts. Its tail is edged with a narrow band of creamy yellow and
                        is dark grey edged with creamy yellow underneath, and the tail feathers are green centrally and
                        bluer as they get towards the edges. The grand Eclectus female is mostly bright red with a
                        darker hue on the back and wings. The mantle and underwing coverts darken to a more purple in
                        colour, and the wing is edged with a mauve-blue. The tail is edged with yellowish-orange above
                        and is more orange tipped with yellow underneath. The upper mandible of the adult male is orange
                        at the base fading to a yellow towards the tip, and the lower mandible is black. The beak of the
                        adult female is all black. Adults have yellow to orange irises and juveniles have dark brown to
                        black irises. The upper mandible of both male and female juveniles are brown at the base fading
                        to yellow towards the biting edges and the tip.</p>
                    <p>The above description is for the nominate race. The abdomen and nape of the females are blue in
                        most subspecies, purple abdomen and nape in the subspecies (roratus) and lavender abdomen and
                        nape in the (vosmaeri) subspecies from the north and the central Maluku Islands, and red abdomen
                        and nape in the subspecies from Sumba and Tanimbar Islands (Cornelia and riedeli). Females of
                        two subspecies have a wide band of yellow on the tail tip, riedeli and vosmaeri which also have
                        yellow undertail coverts. The female vosmaeri displays the brightest red of all the subspecies,
                        both on the head and body. They don't tend to talk in clear voices until they are 1 year old.
