                    <h3>Pileated woodpecker</h3><br>
                    <p>The pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) is a large, mostly black woodpecker native to North
                        America. An insectivore, it inhabits deciduous forests in eastern North America, the Great
                        Lakes, the boreal forests of Canada, and parts of the Pacific Coast. It is the largest extant
                        woodpecker species in North America, with the possible exception of the ivory-billed woodpecker,
                        which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed be reclassified as extinct. It is also the
                        third largest species of woodpecker in the world, after the great slaty woodpecker and the black
                        woodpecker. "Pileated" refers to the bird's prominent red crest, from the Latin pileatus meaning
                        "capped".</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Description :</h3><br>
                    <p>Adults are 40 to 49 cm (16 to 19 in) long, span 66 to 75 cm (26 to 30 in) across the wings, and
                        weigh 225 to 400 g (7.9 to 14.1 oz). The average weight of females and males combined is about
                        277 g (9.8 oz), with males weighing about 300 g (11 oz) and females weighing about 256 g (9.0
                        oz) in mean body mass. The wing chord measures 21.4 to 25.3 cm (8.4 to 10.0 in), the tail
                        measures 14.0 to 17.4 cm (5.5 to 6.9 in), the bill is 4.1 to 6.0 cm (1.6 to 2.4 in) and the
                        tarsus measures 3.1 to 3.8 cm (1.2 to 1.5 in). The northern subspecies is generally
                        slightly larger than the southern. Pileated woodpeckers are mainly black with a red crest, and
                        have a white line down the sides of the throat. Younger specimens tend to have less curved
                        crests, or "mohawks" as some refer to them. They show white on the wings in flight. The flight
                        of these birds is strong and direct, but undulates in the way characteristic of woodpeckers.
                        Adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat; in adult females these are black.
                        Two species found in the Old World, the White-bellied woodpecker (D. javensis) and black
                        woodpeckers (D. martius), are closely related and occupy the same ecological niche in their
                        respective ranges that the pileated occupies in North America. The only North American birds
                        of similar plumage and size were the ivory-billed woodpecker of the southeastern United States
                        and Cuba, and the related imperial woodpecker of Mexico, both of which have been declared
                        probably extinct.</p>
