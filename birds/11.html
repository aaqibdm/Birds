                    <h3>Macaw</h3><br>
                    <p>Macaws are a group of New World parrots that are long-tailed and often colorful.[1] They are
                        popular in aviculture or as companion parrots, although there are conservation concerns about
                        several species in the wild.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Description :</h3><br>
                    <p>It is about 81 centimeters (32 in) long, of which more than half is the pointed, graduated tail
                        typical of all macaws, though the scarlet macaw has a larger percentage of tail than the other
                        large macaws. The average weight is about 1 kilogram (2 lb 3 oz). The plumage is mostly scarlet,
                        but the rump and tail-covert feathers are light blue, the greater upper wing coverts are yellow,
                        the upper sides of the flight feathers of the wings are dark blue as are the ends of the tail
                        feathers, and the undersides of the wing and tail flight feathers are dark red with metallic
                        gold iridescence. Some individuals may have green in the wings.</p>
                    <p>There is bare white skin around the eye and from there to the bill. Tiny white feathers are
                        contained on the face patch. The upper mandible is mostly pale horn in color and the lower is
                        black. Juveniles have dark eyes; adults have light yellow eyes.</p>

                    <p> It is frequently confused with the slightly larger green-winged macaw, which has more distinct
                        red lines in the face and no yellow in the wing.</p>
                    <p>Scarlet macaws make very loud, high and sometimes low-pitched, throaty squawks, squeaks and
                        screams designed to carry many kilometers to call for their groups.</p>

                    <p> The scarlet macaw can live up to 75 or even 90 years in captivity, although a more typical
                        lifespan is 40 to 50 years.</p>
