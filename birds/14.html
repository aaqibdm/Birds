                    <h3>Sun parakeet</h3><br>
                    <p>The sun parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis), also known in aviculture as the sun conure, is a
                        medium-sized, vibrantly colored parrot native to northeastern South America. The adult male and
                        female are similar in appearance, with predominantly golden-yellow plumage and orange-flushed
                        underparts and face. Sun parakeets are very social birds, typically living in flocks. They form
                        monogamous pairs for reproduction, and nest in palm cavities in the tropics. Sun parakeets
                        mainly feed on fruits, flowers, berries, blossoms, seeds, nuts, and insects. Conures are
                        commonly bred and kept in aviculture and may live up to 30 years. This species is currently
                        threatened by loss of habitat and trapping for plumage or the pet trade. Sun parakeets are now
                        listed as endangered by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Description :</h3><br>
                    <p>On average, sun parakeets weigh around 110 g (4 oz) and are around 30 cm (12 in) long. The
                        sexes are similar in plumage, although hens may be lighter and more slender in body, having a
                        shorter tail, with a smaller, rounder head and a smaller beak. Adults have a rich yellow
                        crown, nape, mantle, lesser wing-coverts, tips of the greater wing-coverts, chest, and
                        underwing-coverts. The face and belly are orange with red around the ears. The base of the
                        greater wing-coverts, tertials, and base of the primaries are green, while the secondaries, tips
                        of the primaries, and most of the primary coverts are dark blue. The tail is olive-green with a
                        blue tip. From below, all the flight feathers are dark greyish. The bill is black. The legs and
                        the bare eye-ring are grey, but the latter often fades to white in captivity (so using amount of
                        grey or white in the eye-ring for determining "purity" of an individual can be misleading). It
                        is easily confused with the closely related jandaya parakeet and sulphur-breasted parakeet, but
                        the former has entirely green wing-coverts, mantle, and vent, while the latter has green
                        mottling to the mantle and less orange to the underparts. The sun parakeet is also superficially
                        similar to the pale-billed. Super Sun Conure is often also named by breeders as (Yellow-Factor
                        Sun Conure) since there is also (Red-Factor Sun Conure).Juvenile sun parakeets display a predominantly green plumage and resemble similar-aged
                        sulphur-breasted parakeets. The distinctive yellow, orange, and reddish colouration on the back,
                        abdomen, and head is attained with maturity.</p>
