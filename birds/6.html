                    <h3>Rose-ringed parakeet</h3><br>
                    <p>The rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), also known as the ring-necked parakeet (more
                        commonly known as the Indian ringneck parrot), is a medium-sized parrot in the genus Psittacula,
                        of the family Psittacidae. It has disjunct native ranges in Africa and the Indian Subcontinent,
                        and is now introduced into many other parts of the world where feral populations have
                        established themselves and are bred for the exotic pet trade</p>

                    <p>One of the few parrot species that have successfully adapted to living in disturbed habitats, it
                        has withstood the onslaught of urbanisation and deforestation. As a popular pet species, escaped
                        birds have colonised a number of cities around the world, including Northern and Western
                        Europe. These parakeets have also proven themselves capable of living in a variety of
                        climates outside their native range, and are able to survive low winter temperatures in Northern
                        Europe. The species is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation
                        of Nature (IUCN) because its population appears to be increasing, but its popularity as a pet
                        and unpopularity with farmers has reduced its numbers in some parts of its native range.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Description :</h3><br>
                    <p>The rose-ringed parakeet is sexually dimorphic. The adult male sports a red and black neck ring,
                        and the hen and immature birds of both sexes either show no neck rings, or display shadow-like
                        pale to dark grey neck rings. Both sexes have a distinctive green colour in the wild, and
                        captive bred ringnecks have multiple colour mutations which include turquoise, cinnamon, olive,
                        white, blue, violet, grey and yellow. Rose-ringed parakeets measure on average 40 cm (16 in) in
                        length, including the tail feathers, a large portion of their total length. Their average
                        single-wing length is about 15 to 17.5 cm (5.9 to 6.9 in). In the wild, this is a noisy species
                        with an unmistakable squawking call. Captive individuals can be taught to speak. They are a
                        herbivorous and non-migratory species.</p>
