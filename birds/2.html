                    <h3>Superb starling</h3><br>
                    <p>The superb starling (Lamprotornis superbus) is a member of the starling family of birds. It was
                        formerly known as Spreo superbus.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Description :</h3><br>
                    <p>This species is 18 to 19 cm (7.1 to 7.5 in) long.[3] These small short-tailed starlings have a
                        long narrow bill, robust bodies, strong feet and a distinctive plumage pattern. Adults have
                        black heads and iridescent blue-to-green back, upper breast, wings, and tail. The belly is
                        red-orange, separated from the blue breast by a white bar. The undertail coverts and the wing
                        linings are white. Juveniles have duller plumage with no more than a suggestion of the white
                        breast band. Their eyes are brown at first, later grayish white.</p>

                    <p>The superb starling has a long and loud song consisting of trills and chatters. At midday it
                        gives a softer song of repeated phrases. There are several harsh calls, the most complex of
                        which is described as "a shrill, screeching skerrrreeee-cherrrroo-tcherreeeeeet."</p>

                    <p>The appearance of the superb starling is very similar to Hildebrandt's starling, also found in
                        East Africa. The superb starling is distinguished by having pale creamy-white eyes, as opposed
                        to red eyes in the Hildebrandt's. Moreover, only adult superb starlings have a white breast
                        band.</p>
