                    <h3>Yellow-collared lovebird</h3><br>
                    <p>The yellow-collared lovebird (Agapornis personatus), also called masked lovebird, black-masked
                        lovebird or eye ring lovebird, is a monotypic species of bird of the lovebird genus in the
                        parrot family Psittaculidae. They are native to Arusha Region of Tanzania and have been
                        introduced to Burundi and Kenya. Although they have been observed in the wild in Puerto Rico,
                        they are probably the result of escaped pets, and no reproduction has been recorded. They
                        have also been observed in Arizona.</p>
