                    <h3>American flamingo</h3><br>
                    <p>The American flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber) is a large species of flamingo closely related to
                        the greater flamingo and Chilean flamingo native to the Neotropics. It was formerly considered
                        conspecific with the greater flamingo, but that treatment is now widely viewed (e.g. by the
                        American and British Ornithologists' Unions) as incorrect due to a lack of evidence. It is also
                        known as the Caribbean flamingo, although it is also present in the Gal√°pagos Islands. It is the
                        only flamingo that naturally inhabits North America.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Description :</h3><br>
                    <p>The American flamingo is a large wading bird with reddish-pink plumage. Like all flamingos, it
                        lays a single chalky-white egg on a mud mound, between May and August; incubation until hatching
                        takes from 28 to 32 days; both parents brood the young for a period up to 6 years when they
                        reach sexual maturity. Their life expectancy of 40 years is one of the longest in birds.</p>
                    <p>Adult American flamingos are smaller on average than greater flamingos, but are the largest
                        flamingos in the Americas. They measure from 120 to 145 cm (47 to 57 in) tall. The males weigh
                        an average of 2.8 kg (6.2 lb), while females average 2.2 kg (4.9 lb). Most of its plumage is
                        pink, giving rise to its earlier name of rosy flamingo and differentiating adults from the much
                        paler greater flamingo. The wing coverts are red, and the primary and secondary flight feathers
                        are black. The bill is pink and white with an extensive black tip. The legs are entirely pink.
                        The call is a goose-like honking.</p>
